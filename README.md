#san_email_bomber# is a tool I created that can be used to perform call and SMS bombing on the target Email address.  You must ensure that you always install the latest version of EmBomber from GitHub in order to not get stuck with the working of the tool. This tool works with open-source intelligence APIs thatâ€™s why this tool requires an internet connection to perform bombing. EmBomber is a free and an open-source tool available on GitHub. This tool takes your email address. You only have to enter the target email address and the tool will do the rest of the work.

Note: This tool is written in Python. You must have python installed in your kali linux operating system.
